## Background Information

This project is a **Location-Based Services (LBS)** application that leverages **Google Maps API** to render time-based sequential lines and Point of Interest (POI) data. The system integrates IoT devices to generate location-based time sequences and provides a comprehensive visualization platform.

## Project Overview

### Core Features
- **Time-based Sequential Lines**: Renders movement patterns and trajectories over time using Google Maps API
- **POI Visualization**: Displays Point of Interest pictures and comments on the map
- **Real-time Data Processing**: IoT devices generate location data with timestamps
- **Queue-based Architecture**: Asynchronous processing of location data through message queues
- **Data Storage**: Persistent storage of location and POI information

### System Architecture

#### IoT Device Layer
- IoT devices equipped with GPS/positioning sensors
- Generate time-stamped location data
- Send data to message queue for processing

#### Data Processing Layer
- Message queue system for handling incoming IoT data
- Data validation and preprocessing
- Storage in database/datastore

#### Visualization Layer
- Google Maps API integration
- Time-based sequential line rendering
- POI marker display with pictures and comments
- Interactive map interface

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Web application with Google Maps API
- **Backend**: Data processing and storage services
- **IoT**: Location-enabled devices
- **Queue System**: Message queuing for data ingestion
- **Database**: Persistent storage for location and POI data

### Use Cases
- **Fleet Tracking**: Monitor vehicle movements and routes
- **Asset Tracking**: Track valuable assets in real-time
- **Activity Monitoring**: Visualize user or object movement patterns
- **POI Management**: Manage and display points of interest with rich metadata
